### Software
* Calculations in this class can get messy and the solutions change in space and time, so we will often use Mathematica for calculation and visualization. Go [here](#getting-mathematica) to get Mathematica. 
  * Many homework sets, including the first one, will involve
  Mathematica work. 
* We'll use Top Hat for daily quizzes. TTU has a site license; if you're a TTU student, get your free app [here](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/itts/software/tophat.php).
