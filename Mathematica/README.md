## Getting Mathematica
* Get a [*Mathematica* student license](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/pricing/students/) from Wolfram. Cost as of Aug 2024 is $75/year or $50/semester.
  * License includes both cloud and desktop version. I recommend working with desktop version, as some nice features (*e.g.* subscripting with shortcut keys) aren't available in the cloud version.
* *Mathematica* is available for free on Raspberry Pi computers running PiOS.
