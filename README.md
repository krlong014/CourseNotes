### Classes
* [Differential Equations 2](#DE2)
* [Math Methods for Physics 2](#MM2)

### Mathematica

* [Getting Mathematica](#GetMMA)
* [Configuring Mathematica](#ConfMMA)
 



# Differential equations 2 {#DE2}

## Topics
* Systems of ordinary differential equations
  * Linear systems
  * Nonlinear autonomous systems
* Boundary value problems and Fourier series
* Partial differential equations
* Fourier transforms

## Course materials

### Software
* Calculations in this class can get messy and the solutions change in space and time, so we will often use Mathematica for calculation and visualization. Go [here](#GetMMA) to get Mathematica. 
  * Many homework sets, including the first one, will involve
  Mathematica work. 
* We'll use Top Hat for daily quizzes. TTU has a site license; if you're a TTU student, get your free app [here](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/itts/software/tophat.php).


### Textbook

Boyce, DiPrima, and Meade, *Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems.* 
* Current edition is 12th, but 9th or later will suffice.
* Amazon has used copies in good condition for around $20.


# Math Methods for Physics 2 {#MM2}

Topics
* Analysis of scalar and vector fields
* Partial differential equations in physics
* Fourier transforms
* Calculus of variations



# Mathematica help {#MMAHelp}

## Getting Mathematica{#GetMMA}
* Get a [*Mathematica* student license](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/pricing/students/) from Wolfram. Cost as of Aug 2024 is $75/year
  * License includes both cloud and desktop version. I recommend working with desktop version, as some nice features (*e.g.* subscripting with shortcut keys) aren't available in the cloud version.
* *Mathematica* is available for free on Raspberry Pi computers running PiOS.
